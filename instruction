Each character (including space) has been coded into binary numbers using ASCII code.

The ASCII-coded binary numbers have been arranged in raster scan order (Figure 1) to form an 8 x 16binary matrix (Figure 2).

Each ASCII-coded binary number in odd rows (1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th) has been added a number equivalent to its row number.

Each ASCII-coded binary number in even rows (0th, 2nd, 4th and 6th) has been subtracted a number equivalent to its row number.

The 8th column of the 8 x 16 matrix has been cut and inserted into the left side of the 0th column.

The newly formed binary number (cascading two numbers into one) in each row has been converted to a hexadecimal number.
