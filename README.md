# decoder-script
My teacher assigned me to decode a set of hexadecimal numbers into binary, preform some binary shifting and addition, and convert to ascii. I decided to write a python script to do it for me. 


HOW TO USE:
Download "decode.py" or copy and paste the script into a python environment. Change the value of the variable "hexadecimal" into the hexadecimal code that you want to decode. Decode.py will output the decoded message and the process of decoding according to the instruction set.
